# CSC 547 Artificial Intelligence - Assignment 1
<br>This repository contains the first assignment for the CSC 547 Artificial Intelligence course at the University of South Dakota, offered in the Masters of Science in Computer Science program. The instructor of the course is Kruttika Sutrave.
<br>
<br>
The assignment is implemented on Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computational environment that allows for creating and sharing live code, visualizations, and narrative text. The assignment involves creating and manipulating data frames using the pandas library in Python, a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation.
<br>
The objective of this assignment is to introduce the students to the basics of data frames, their manipulation and merging using pandas, which are essential skills for any data analysis or machine learning task. The assignment includes exercises on creating data frames from raw data, joining data frames along rows and columns, and merging data frames based on common keys.
<br>
The code for the assignment is provided in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file, which includes the problem statement, the code, and the output. The students are required to complete the missing parts of the code and submit the pdf version of your Jupyter notebook for grading.
